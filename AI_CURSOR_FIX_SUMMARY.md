# AI Cursor & Theatrical Execution - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå AI Cursor Not Appearing (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** AI cursor simulation wasn't working - shapes appeared instantly with no visual feedback.

**Root Cause:** Incorrect Awareness API usage
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - method doesn't exist
awareness.setLocalStateField("aiAgent", agentState);

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - proper API usage
awareness.states.set(aiClientId, { presence: agentState });
awareness.emit("update", [
  { added: [], updated: [aiClientId], removed: [] },
  "local",
]);
```

**Impact:** Complete feature non-functional - no theatrical effect at all

**Resolution:** Use correct Awareness protocol methods to manipulate states Map and emit updates

---

### 2. ‚ùå AI Inference Errors (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** 
```
InferenceUpstreamError [AiError]: 8001: Invalid input
at async Ai.run (cloudflare-internal:ai-api:190:19)
```

**Root Cause:** Mistral model incompatible with Workers AI `tools` parameter

**Model Evolution:**
1. `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast` ‚ùå (original, timeouts)
2. `@cf/mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct` ‚ùå (incompatible API)
3. `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct` ‚úÖ (proven compatible)

**Resolution:** Switched to Llama 3.1 70B which has proven compatibility with function calling

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Merged Latest Updates

**Changes merged:**
- E2E test improvements and fixes
- Canvas interaction improvements  
- Export and z-index test fixes
- Layers panel collapse by default
- Accessibility improvements

## How AI Cursor Works Now

### Execution Flow

1. **User sends AI command** ‚Üí Frontend sends prompt + context
2. **AI generates tool calls** ‚Üí Llama 3.1 70B returns structured tools
3. **Simulator creates virtual client:**
   ```typescript
   const aiClientId = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000000);
   awareness.states.set(aiClientId, {
     presence: {
       userId: "ai-agent-...",
       displayName: userName,
       color: "#8b5cf6", // Purple
       cursor: { x, y },
       isAIAgent: true,
       aiProgress: { current: 1, total: 5, message: "Creating shapes" }
     }
   });
   ```
4. **Execute tools slowly** with delays:
   - Move cursor to position
   - Wait 100ms (cursor travel)
   - Wait 50ms (thinking pause)
   - Execute tool in Yjs transaction
   - Wait for operation-specific delay (300ms for shapes)
   - Update progress indicator
5. **Cleanup:** Remove virtual client from awareness

### Visual Appearance

**AI Cursor:**
- Purple color (#8b5cf6) vs user cursors
- Larger size (14px vs 12px)
- Glow effect (shadow blur: 8px)
- Label: "ü§ñ Agent by [UserName]"
- Bold font
- Progress text: "2/5 Creating shapes"

**Timing:**
- Shape creation: 300ms + 50ms per additional shape
- Movement: 200ms per operation
- Style changes: 150ms
- Cursor movement: 100ms between operations
- Total: 5-10s for complex commands

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Basic Operations
- [ ] AI cursor appears when sending command
- [ ] Cursor is purple with robot emoji
- [ ] Progress shows "X/Y [Operation]"
- [ ] Cursor moves between operations
- [ ] Cursor disappears after completion

### ‚úÖ Context Awareness
- [ ] "create a circle here" uses viewport center
- [ ] "arrange selected shapes" works with selection
- [ ] "move these to center" works with multiple selected
- [ ] AI knows about canvas statistics

### ‚úÖ Multi-User
- [ ] User A sees User B's AI cursor
- [ ] Both users can trigger AI simultaneously
- [ ] Cursors don't conflict
- [ ] Everyone sees same progression

### ‚úÖ Complex Commands
- [ ] 20+ shapes don't timeout (60s timeout)
- [ ] 4x5 grid creation works
- [ ] Pattern creation staggers properly
- [ ] History updates correctly

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Timing Budget
- Simple (1 shape): ~400ms total
- Medium (5 shapes): ~1.5s total
- Complex (20 shapes): ~5s total
- Very complex (50 shapes): ~8s total

### Network Impact
- Awareness updates: ~10-20 per execution
- Throttled by Awareness protocol (20Hz)
- No impact on other users' interactions
- All tool operations atomic (single Yjs transaction per tool)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Sequential execution only** - Tools execute one at a time for visibility
2. **No cancellation** - Can't interrupt mid-execution (future enhancement)
3. **Fixed timing** - Doesn't adapt based on actual operation complexity
4. **Server-side only** - Simulation runs in RoomDO, not client-side

---

## Debugging Tips

If AI cursor doesn't appear:
1. Check browser console for Awareness errors
2. Verify `awareness.states` has the AI client ID
3. Check WebSocket connection is active
4. Inspect `awareness.emit()` calls in RoomDO logs
5. Verify AI is returning tool calls (not erroring)

If AI commands fail:
1. Check for "8001: Invalid input" ‚Üí model incompatibility
2. Check for timeout errors ‚Üí increase timeout or simplify prompt
3. Check tool parameter validation ‚Üí shapes array format
4. Check Yjs transaction errors ‚Üí shape creation failures

## Next Steps

Ready to test! The AI cursor should now:
- ‚úÖ Appear during execution with purple color and robot emoji
- ‚úÖ Show progress indicators
- ‚úÖ Move between operations
- ‚úÖ Execute tools slowly with proper timing
- ‚úÖ Work reliably with Llama 3.1 70B model
- ‚úÖ Be visible to all connected users

Try these test commands:
- "create a blue circle at 500, 500"
- "create 5 red squares in a row"
- "create a 3x3 grid of green circles"
- (Select shapes first) "arrange these in a vertical line"
