# AI Integration Improvements - Phase 1 Polish

## Changes Made

### 1. **Switched AI Model** ✅
- **Old**: `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`
- **New**: `@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b`
- **Why**: Hermes 2 Pro is specifically optimized for function calling and has better adherence to tool schemas

### 2. **Improved System Prompt** ✅
Added explicit rules to prevent AI hallucinations:

```
CRITICAL RULES:
1. ONLY create the EXACT number of shapes requested by the user
2. Use createShape for single shapes, createMultipleShapes ONLY when explicitly asked for multiple
3. When user says "2 rectangles" → call createShape or createMultipleShapes with EXACTLY 2 shapes
4. NEVER create hundreds of shapes - maximum 50 shapes per command
5. We do NOT support triangles, polygons, or other shapes - only rectangles, circles, text
6. Size modifiers: "tiny" = 30-50px, "small" = 70-100px, "regular/normal" = 120-150px, "large/huge" = 200-300px
7. "side by side" means horizontal layout with 20px spacing
```

### 3. **Pre-Execution Validation** ✅
Added `validateToolCalls()` function that checks BEFORE executing:

**Validates:**
- ✅ Maximum 50 shapes per command
- ✅ Minimum dimensions (rectangles: 10x10px, circles: 5px radius, text: 8px font)
- ✅ Maximum dimensions (within canvas bounds)
- ✅ Unsupported shape types (rejects triangles, polygons, etc.)
- ✅ Total shape count across all tool calls

**Result:**
If validation fails, returns error to user with specific reason instead of executing bad commands.

### 4. **Debug Logging** ✅
Added console logging to help debug AI behavior:
```typescript
console.log(`[AI] Generated ${toolCalls.length} tool calls:`, ...);
```

You'll now see in the console:
- How many tool calls the AI made
- What each tool call is
- Validation errors if any

### 5. **Better History Messages** ✅
Improved the response messages shown in AI history:
- **Before**: "Created rectangle shape; Created rectangle shape; ..." (repetitive)
- **After**: "Created 2 shapes" (concise and accurate)

### 6. **Error Feedback** ✅
Users now get clear error messages when AI tries invalid operations:
- "Rectangle too small: 5x5px (minimum 10x10px)"
- "AI tried to create 180 shapes at once. Maximum is 50 shapes per command"
- "Unsupported shape type: triangle. Only rectangles, circles, and text are supported"

---

## Testing the Improvements

### Commands to Test

**Should Now Work Correctly:**
1. ✅ "create 2 tiny yellow rectangles in the center of my viewport"
   - Expected: 2 shapes created (30-50px size)
   
2. ✅ "create 2 huge rectangles, 1 purple, 1 pink"
   - Expected: 2 shapes created (200-300px size)
   
3. ✅ "create 5 regular circles side by side"
   - Expected: 5 shapes created in horizontal layout
   
4. ✅ "create 5 rectangles side by side"
   - Expected: 5 shapes created in horizontal layout

**Should Be Rejected:**
1. ❌ "create a huge triangle"
   - Expected: Error "Unsupported shape type: triangle"
   
2. ❌ "create 200 circles"
   - Expected: Error "AI tried to create 200 shapes at once. Maximum is 50"

### Debug Workflow

If you see unexpected behavior:

1. **Check Browser Console** (when testing locally with `npm run dev:worker`):
   ```
   [AI] Generated 1 tool calls: createMultipleShapes({"shapes":[...]})
   ```
   This shows what the AI is actually trying to do

2. **Check Validation Logs**:
   ```
   [AI] Validation failed: ["AI tried to create 180 shapes..."]
   ```
   This shows why a command was rejected

3. **Check AI History**:
   - Should now show accurate shape counts
   - Shows error messages if validation failed

## What This Fixes

### Issue #1: AI Creating 100s of Shapes ✅
**Problem**: "create 2 rectangles" → 180 shapes created  
**Fix**: Validation now rejects any command trying to create > 50 shapes  
**Result**: User gets clear error instead of canvas flooded with shapes

### Issue #2: No Feedback on Failures ✅
**Problem**: AI says "created shapes" but nothing visible (too small)  
**Fix**: Validation checks minimum dimensions, rejects too-small shapes  
**Result**: User gets error like "Rectangle too small: 5x5px (minimum 10x10px)"

### Issue #3: AI Attempting Unsupported Shapes ✅
**Problem**: User asks for "triangle" → creates 279 random shapes?  
**Fix**: Validation rejects unsupported shape types  
**Result**: User gets error "Unsupported shape type: triangle"

### Issue #4: Poor History Messages ✅
**Problem**: "Created rectangle shape; Created rectangle shape; ..." repeated 180 times  
**Fix**: Improved history to show "Created 180 shapes" (concise)  
**Result**: History panel readable and informative

## Architecture

```
User Input → Worker
            ↓
      Workers AI (Hermes 2 Pro)
            ↓
      Tool Calls Generated
            ↓
      validateToolCalls() ← NEW!
            ↓
      ✓ Valid? → Execute in DO
      ✗ Invalid? → Return Error to User
```

**Key Improvement**: Validation happens BEFORE execution, preventing bad commands from reaching the canvas.

## Next Steps (If Still Seeing Issues)

1. **Check Console Logs**: See what tool calls AI is generating
2. **Adjust System Prompt**: May need more explicit instructions for certain commands
3. **Try Different Model**: Can experiment with `llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast` or `mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct`
4. **Add More Validation**: Can tighten rules if needed
