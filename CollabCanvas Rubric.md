* Some lag during rapid edits

**Poor (0-5 points)**

* Inconsistent sync  
* Frequent delays over 300ms  
* Broken under concurrent edits

### Conflict Resolution & State Management (9 points)

**Excellent (8-9 points)**

* Two users edit same object simultaneously → both see consistent final state  
* Documented strategy (last-write-wins, CRDT, OT, etc.)  
* No "ghost" objects or duplicates  
* Rapid edits (10+ changes/sec) don't corrupt state  
* Clear visual feedback on who last edited

**Good (6-7 points)**

* Simultaneous edits resolve correctly 90%+ of time  
* Strategy documented  
* Minor visual artifacts (brief flicker) but state stays consistent  
* Occasional ghost objects that self-correct

**Satisfactory (4-5 points)**

* Simultaneous edits sometimes create duplicates  
* Strategy unclear or undocumented  
* State inconsistencies require refresh  
* No indication of edit conflicts

**Poor (0-3 points)**

* Simultaneous edits frequently corrupt state  
* Objects duplicate or disappear  
* Different users see different canvas states  
* Requires manual intervention to fix

**Testing Scenarios for Conflict Resolution:**

1. Simultaneous Move: User A and User B both drag the same rectangle at the same time  
2. Rapid Edit Storm: User A resizes object while User B changes its color while User C moves it  
3. Delete vs Edit: User A deletes an object while User B is actively editing it  
4. Create Collision: Two users create objects at nearly identical timestamps

### Persistence & Reconnection (9 points)

**Excellent (8-9 points)**

* User refreshes mid-edit → returns to exact state  
* All users disconnect → canvas persists fully  
* Network drop (30s+) → auto-reconnects with complete state  
* Operations during disconnect queue and sync on reconnect  
* Clear UI indicator for connection status

**Good (6-7 points)**

* Refresh preserves 95%+ of state  
* Reconnection works but may lose last 1-2 operations  
* Connection status shown  
* Minor data loss on network issues

**Satisfactory (4-5 points)**

* Refresh loses recent changes (last 10-30 seconds)  
* Reconnection requires manual refresh  
* Inconsistent persistence  
* No clear connection indicators

**Poor (0-3 points)**

* Refresh loses significant work  
* Reconnection fails or requires new session  
* Canvas resets when last user leaves  
* Frequent data loss

**Testing Scenarios for Persistence:**

1. Mid-Operation Refresh: User drags object, refreshes browser mid-drag → object position preserved  
2. Total Disconnect: All users close browsers, wait 2 minutes, return → full canvas state intact  
3. Network Simulation: Throttle network to 0 for 30 seconds, restore → canvas syncs without data loss  
4. Rapid Disconnect: User makes 5 rapid edits, immediately closes tab → edits persist for other users
