# AI Agent Implementation Notes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. AI Cursor Not Appearing (Critical Bug)

**Problem:** The theatrical AI cursor simulation wasn't working - shapes appeared instantly instead of slowly with cursor animation.

**Root Cause:** Incorrect Awareness API usage
- Used `awareness.setLocalStateField()` which doesn't exist
- The Awareness protocol doesn't have this method

**Fix:** 
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
awareness.setLocalStateField("aiAgent", agentState);

// AFTER (correct):
awareness.states.set(aiClientId, { presence: agentState });
awareness.emit("update", [
  { added: [], updated: [aiClientId], removed: [] },
  "local",
]);
```

This properly:
- Manipulates the awareness states Map directly
- Emits update events to broadcast to all clients
- Creates a virtual client that all users can see

### 2. AI Model Upgrade

**Changed from:** `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast`
**Changed to:** `@cf/mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct`

**Reasoning:**
- Mistral models excel at function calling and structured output
- Better reliability for tool execution commands
- More consistent results with complex tool chains

## Architecture Summary

### AI Cursor Simulation Flow

1. **AI generates tool calls** (instant, as before)
2. **Simulator creates virtual client** in Awareness
   ```typescript
   const aiClientId = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000000);
   awareness.states.set(aiClientId, { presence: agentState });
   ```
3. **Execute tools slowly** with delays between operations
4. **Move cursor** to operation positions before executing
5. **Update progress** indicators in real-time
6. **Clean up** by removing virtual client when done

### Key Implementation Details

**Timing Configuration:**
- Shape creation: 300ms base + 50ms per additional shape
- Shape movement: 200ms per operation
- Cursor travel: 100ms between operations
- Total budget: 5-10s for complex commands

**State Structure:**
```typescript
{
  presence: {
    userId: "ai-agent-{userId}-{timestamp}",
    displayName: userName,
    color: "#8b5cf6", // Purple
    cursor: { x, y },
    isAIAgent: true,
    aiAgentOwner: userId,
    aiProgress: {
      current: 2,
      total: 5,
      message: "Creating shapes"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

The AI cursor should now:
- ✅ Appear during command execution
- ✅ Show progress indicators ("2/5 Creating shapes")
- ✅ Move between operation positions
- ✅ Be visible to all connected users
- ✅ Disappear after completion

## Debugging Tips

If AI cursor still doesn't appear:
1. Check browser console for Awareness errors
2. Verify WebSocket connection is established
3. Check that awareness updates are being received
4. Inspect awareness.states Map in RoomDO
5. Ensure AI is actually calling tools (check response format)

## Performance Notes

- Simulation adds intentional delays (5-10s for complex commands)
- All operations still execute within Yjs transactions (atomic)
- Awareness updates throttled to 20Hz by protocol
- No impact on other users' interactions during AI execution

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add cancellation support (interrupt mid-execution)
- [ ] Implement drawing animations (stroke-by-stroke creation)
- [ ] Add sound effects for AI operations
- [ ] Show AI cursor path trails
- [ ] Dynamic model selection based on command complexity
