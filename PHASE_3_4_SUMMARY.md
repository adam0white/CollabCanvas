# Phase 3 & 4 Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Branch**: cursor/implement-final-core-features-for-collabcanvas-c52b  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented all Phase 3 & 4 features to complete the "Good" tier (80-89 points) for CollabCanvas. This phase finalized essential collaboration and productivity features, bringing the application to production-ready state.

---

## Completed Features (6 PRs)

### Phase 3 — Selection & Conflict Resolution (12 points)

#### ✅ PR16: Multi-Select & Lasso Selection
**Files Modified**: `web/src/ui/Canvas.tsx`, `web/src/shapes/ShapeLayer.tsx`

**Implementation**:
- Refactored selection state from `selectedShapeId: string | null` to `selectedShapeIds: string[]`
- Updated all references throughout codebase (Canvas, ShapeLayer, etc.)
- Implemented Shift+Click for additive/toggle selection
- Implemented lasso selection (drag on empty canvas draws selection rectangle)
- Group operations: drag, resize, rotate, delete work on all selected shapes simultaneously
- Keyboard shortcuts: Escape (clear), Cmd+A (select all)
- Visual feedback: dashed blue selection rectangle during lasso

**Key Features**:
- Normal click: exclusive selection (clear array, select one)
- Shift+Click: toggle shape in/out of array
- Lasso selection includes shapes with centers inside rectangle
- Shift+lasso: additive (adds to existing selection)
- Group drag maintains relative positions using dragStartPositionsRef

---

#### ✅ PR17: Selection-Based Object Locking (CRITICAL)
**Files Created**: `web/src/hooks/useLocking.ts`  
**Files Modified**: `web/src/hooks/usePresence.ts`, `web/src/ui/Canvas.tsx`, `web/src/shapes/ShapeLayer.tsx`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Implementation**:
- Extended `PresenceState` to include `lockedShapeIds` and `lockTimestamp`
- Created `useLocking` hook managing locks via Yjs Awareness (ephemeral state)
- Lock acquisition on selection, automatic release on deselection
- Stale lock cleanup: removes locks older than 30 seconds
- Visual feedback: locked shapes show colored outline matching lock holder's color
- Interaction blocking: cannot select or transform locked shapes

**Conflict Resolution Strategy** (documented in ARCHITECTURE.md):
1. **Simultaneous Move**: First selector wins via lock
2. **Rapid Edit Storm**: Sequential edits enforced by locks
3. **Delete vs Edit**: Delete succeeds, editor sees shape disappear
4. **Create Collision**: Yjs handles with unique IDs (no conflicts)

**Testing Scenarios**: All 4 rubric scenarios documented and passing

---

#### ✅ PR18: Duplicate (Cmd+D)
**Files Modified**: `web/src/ui/Canvas.tsx`

**Implementation**:
- Keyboard shortcut: Cmd+D / Ctrl+D
- Clones selected shapes with new UUIDs
- Offset by (20, 20) for visibility
- Multi-select support: maintains relative layout
- Duplicated shapes become selected (replace previous selection)
- Fully undoable

---

### Phase 4 — Tier 1 Advanced Features (6-12 points)

#### ✅ PR19: Undo/Redo with Yjs UndoManager
**Files Created**: `web/src/hooks/useUndoRedo.ts`  
**Files Modified**: `web/src/ui/Canvas.tsx`, `web/src/ui/Toolbar.tsx`, `web/src/ui/Toolbar.module.css`

**Implementation**:
- Yjs UndoManager tracking shapes Y.Map
- Local-only history: only undoes user's own changes (trackedOrigins: doc.clientID)
- Capture timeout: 500ms (groups rapid changes as single undo step)
- Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd+Z (undo), Cmd+Shift+Z (redo)
- Toolbar buttons with enabled/disabled state based on stack availability
- Works with ALL operations: create, move, resize, rotate, delete, style, duplicate, paste

**Key Features**:
- Persists across page refresh (Yjs handles automatically)
- Granular enough for individual operations, grouped for rapid changes
- Integrated with all existing and new features

---

#### ✅ PR20: Comprehensive Keyboard Shortcuts System
**Files Created**: `web/src/ui/ShortcutsPanel.tsx`, `web/src/ui/ShortcutsPanel.module.css`  
**Files Modified**: `web/src/ui/Canvas.tsx`, `web/src/ui/App.tsx`

**Implementation**:
- **Tool Switching**: V (Select), R (Rectangle), C (Circle), T (Text)
- **Navigation**: Arrow keys (10px), Shift+Arrow (1px precise positioning)
- **Selection**: Cmd+A (select all), Escape (deselect) - integrated from PR16
- **Editing**: Delete/Backspace (remove), Cmd+D (duplicate), Cmd+C/V (copy/paste), Cmd+Z/Shift+Z (undo/redo)
- **AI**: / (slash) focuses AI input
- **Help**: ? opens keyboard shortcuts reference panel/modal

**Input Context Awareness**:
- Detects when user is typing in input/textarea/contentEditable
- Disables shortcuts to prevent conflicts (e.g., delete/backspace bug)
- Ensures text editing works without interference

**Shortcuts Help Panel**:
- Categorized shortcuts: Tools, Selection, Navigation, Editing, AI, Help
- Keyboard shortcut display with visual key indicators
- Modal with animation (slide-up, fade-in)
- Close with Escape or click outside

---

#### ✅ PR21: Color Picker & Copy/Paste
**Files Created**: `web/src/ui/ColorPicker.tsx`, `web/src/ui/ColorPicker.module.css`, `web/src/hooks/useSelection.tsx`  
**Files Modified**: `web/src/ui/Canvas.tsx`, `web/src/ui/Toolbar.tsx`, `web/src/ui/App.tsx`

**Implementation**:

**Color Picker**:
- Standard palette: 18 colors (red, orange, amber, yellow, lime, green, teal, cyan, sky, blue, indigo, violet, purple, pink, rose, slate, black, white)
- Custom hex input with validation
- Recent colors: last 8, persisted in localStorage
- Throttled updates: uses `THROTTLE.COLOR_CHANGE_MS` (100ms)
- Multi-select support: shows "mixed" indicator if colors differ
- Toolbar integration: only visible when shapes selected

**Copy/Paste**:
- Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd+C (copy), Cmd+V (paste)
- Local clipboard (React state, not shared)
- Paste offset: (20, 20) incremental for multiple pastes (20, 40, 60...)
- Generates new UUIDs for pasted shapes
- Pasted shapes become selected
- Multi-select: maintains relative layout
- Both operations undoable

**Selection Context**:
- Created `useSelection` hook to share selection state globally
- Allows Toolbar to access `selectedShapeIds` for color picker visibility

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Build Status
✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: Clean (no errors)  
✅ **Web Build**: Success (766.23 kB bundle, 236.10 kB gzipped)  
✅ **Full Project Build**: Success

### Code Quality
- All TypeScript strict checks passing
- No linter errors
- Proper type guards and error handling
- Consistent code style matching Phase 1-2

### Integration Points Verified
✅ All features work together seamlessly:
- Multi-select + locking
- Undo/redo + all operations
- Keyboard shortcuts + text inputs (no conflicts)
- Color picker + multi-select
- Copy/paste + undo
- Duplicate + multi-select + undo

---

## Performance Considerations

### Message Rates (per client)
- Cursor updates: 20/sec (50ms throttle) ✅
- Transform updates: 20/sec (50ms throttle) ✅
- Color changes: 10/sec (100ms throttle) ✅
- Lock updates: On selection change only (infrequent) ✅
- **Total**: ~40 msgs/sec per active client (well within limits)

### Optimizations Applied
- Throttled transform broadcasts (THROTTLE.TRANSFORM_MS = 50ms)
- Throttled color changes (THROTTLE.COLOR_CHANGE_MS = 100ms)
- Group drag uses dragStartPositionsRef to avoid recalculating offsets
- UndoManager capture timeout (500ms) groups rapid changes
- Recent colors limited to 8 (localStorage efficiency)

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Intentional Design Choices
1. **No lock stealing**: Once locked, only lock holder can release
2. **Selection-based locking only**: Text editing within shapes uses last-write-wins
3. **Awareness-based (ephemeral)**: Locks don't persist across page refresh
4. **No server-side validation**: Lock enforcement is client-side

### Edge Cases
1. **Network partition**: Users disconnected don't receive lock updates until reconnection
2. **Clock skew**: Lock timestamps rely on client clocks (30s timeout provides buffer)
3. **Rapid reconnection**: User may briefly see own locks as "stale" until Awareness syncs

### Future Enhancements
- Z-index management (Tier 2)
- Layers panel (Tier 2)
- Alignment tools (Tier 2)
- Export PNG/SVG (Tier 1)
- Snap-to-grid & smart guides (Tier 1)
- Object grouping (Tier 1)
