# Playwright E2E Test Suite - Actual Test Results

## Test Execution Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Environment**: Development (localhost:5173)  
**Playwright Version**: 1.56.1

## ✅ Working Tests (No Auth Required)

### Smoke Tests - **5/5 PASSING** ✅

All smoke tests pass successfully:

```
✓ app loads and shows main UI elements
✓ app renders canvas  
✓ guest users see disabled tools and sign in button
✓ page title is correct
✓ no console errors on page load
```

**What's tested:**
- App loads and React renders properly
- Konva canvas initializes
- Guest users see appropriate UI (disabled tools, sign in button)
- No JavaScript errors on page load

## ⚠️ Tests Requiring Authentication

### Prerequisites for Full Test Suite

To run authenticated tests, you need to set up:

```bash
# Create web/.env.local with:
TEST_USER_EMAIL=your-test-user@example.com
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=your-test-password
```

These should be valid Clerk test account credentials for the development environment.

### Test Suites Requiring Auth

1. **auth.spec.ts** - Authentication & authorization flows
2. **shapes.spec.ts** - Shape creation/editing (requires editor role)
3. **collaboration.spec.ts** - Multi-user collaboration
4. **ai-basic.spec.ts** - AI basic commands
5. **ai-advanced.spec.ts** - AI advanced commands
6. **ai-history.spec.ts** - AI history sync
7. **ai-complex.spec.ts** - Complex AI commands
8. **edge-cases.spec.ts** - Error handling tests

## Current Status

### ✅ Infrastructure Verified

- **Dev server**: Running on localhost:5173
- **Clerk integration**: Working with real publishable key
- **App rendering**: React + Konva rendering correctly
- **Playwright setup**: Correctly configured and working
- **Test fixtures**: Properly structured
- **Guest mode**: Fully functional

### ⚠️ Blocked by Missing Credentials

- **Authenticated tests**: Cannot run without TEST_USER_EMAIL/PASSWORD
- **Shape operations**: Require editor authentication
- **AI commands**: Require authenticated user
- **Multi-user tests**: Require multiple authenticated sessions

## How to Run Tests

### Option 1: Smoke Tests Only (No Setup Required)

```bash
cd web
npx playwright test smoke.spec.ts
```

**Result**: ✅ All 5 tests pass

### Option 2: Full Test Suite (Requires Credentials)

```bash
# 1. Set up test credentials
echo "TEST_USER_EMAIL=your-email@example.com" >> web/.env.local
echo "TEST_USER_PASSWORD=your-password" >> web/.env.local

# 2. Ensure dev server is running
npm run dev  # In separate terminal

# 3. Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Or run specific test file
npx playwright test shapes.spec.ts
```

## Test Coverage Analysis

### What's Validated ✅

1. **App Bootstrap**
   - React renders without errors
   - Clerk integration works
   - Konva canvas initializes
   - WebSocket connection attempts

2. **Guest Experience**
   - Can view canvas
   - Tools are properly disabled
   - Sign-in button is visible
   - UI is responsive

3. **No Critical Errors**
   - No console errors on load
   - No React rendering errors
   - Proper Clerk initialization

### What Needs Testing ⚠️

1. **Authentication Flows**
   - Sign in/sign out
   - Session persistence
   - Role-based permissions

2. **Shape Operations**
   - Create (rectangle, circle, text)
   - Move, resize, rotate
   - Delete, duplicate
   - Persistence

3. **Real-time Collaboration**
   - Multi-user shape sync
   - Cursor presence
   - Transform sync
   - Conflict resolution

4. **AI Commands**
   - Basic tools (create, move)
   - Advanced tools (resize, rotate, style)
   - Complex commands (layouts, grids)
   - History sync

## Known Issues

### 1. Authentication Fixture Timeout

**Issue**: `authenticatedPage` fixture times out waiting for Clerk login modal

**Cause**: TEST_USER_EMAIL and TEST_USER_PASSWORD environment variables not set

**Solution**: Add credentials to web/.env.local

### 2. WebSocket Backend Connection

**Note**: Tests assume Cloudflare Worker backend is running. For full functionality:

```bash
# Start worker backend in separate terminal
npm run dev:worker
```

## Recommendations

### For Development

1. **Set up test account**: Create a Clerk test account and add credentials
2. **Run backend**: Keep `wrangler dev` running for WebSocket connection
3. **Iterative testing**: Start with smoke tests, then add auth once credentials are configured

### For CI/CD

1. **Store credentials securely**: Use GitHub Secrets or similar
2. **Mock Clerk**: Consider mocking Clerk for faster CI tests
3. **Test isolation**: Ensure each test cleans up properly
4. **Parallel execution**: Be careful with shared state in collaboration tests

## Files Ready for Testing

All test files are complete and ready to run once authentication is configured:

- ✅ `web/tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts` - **PASSING** (5/5 tests)
- ⏸️ `web/tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts` - Blocked (needs credentials)
- ⏸️ `web/tests/e2e/shapes.spec.ts` - Blocked (needs credentials)
- ⏸️ `web/tests/e2e/collaboration.spec.ts` - Blocked (needs credentials)
- ⏸️ `web/tests/e2e/ai-basic.spec.ts` - Blocked (needs credentials)
- ⏸️ `web/tests/e2e/ai-advanced.spec.ts` - Blocked (needs credentials)
- ⏸️ `web/tests/e2e/ai-history.spec.ts` - Blocked (needs credentials)
- ⏸️ `web/tests/e2e/ai-complex.spec.ts` - Blocked (needs credentials)
- ⏸️ `web/tests/e2e/edge-cases.spec.ts` - Blocked (needs credentials)

## Next Steps

1. **Add test credentials** to `web/.env.local`
2. **Start worker backend** with `npm run dev:worker`
3. **Run full test suite** with `npm run test:e2e`
4. **Review failures** - Some failures expected (they find real bugs!)
5. **Iterate on flaky tests** - Improve selectors and waits as needed

## Conclusion

The Playwright E2E test infrastructure is **fully functional** and ready for use. The smoke tests prove the setup works correctly. Once test credentials are configured, the remaining 94 tests can be executed to provide comprehensive coverage of all CollabCanvas features.
